# ICS3U6
My work from Grade 11 Compsci two years ago.

<br>
I claim no responsibilities for any broken code, and make no guarantees that any of the code actually works.
<br>
Please do not copy the code directly, for that would be plagiarism.
<br> 
For Robot World, you need to set up your compiler to also add the jar for Robot World, for it contains proprietary code written by G. Ridout
<br> 
Any "practice questions" can be found in the "ICS3U6 Course Pack.pdf" file, also included. I did not create the course pack, it is the work of G. Ridout.
